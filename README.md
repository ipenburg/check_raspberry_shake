# NAME

check\_raspberry\_shake - check the status of a Raspberry Shake

# USAGE

**check\_raspberry\_shake** **-H** _host_ **-f** _function_â€¦

# DESCRIPTION

**check\_raspberry\_shake** checks the status of several properties of a Raspberry
Shake.

# REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

The host 

# OPTIONS

- ** -?, -h, --help**

    Show help

- ** -v, --verbose**

    Be more verbose

- **--version**

    Show version and license

- **--function**

    Check for function:

    - status: Running or not
    - version: System software version, default warns if not 0.15
    - producer: Data Producer on or not
    - consumer: Data Consumer on or not
    - forwarding: Data Forwarding on or not
    - connected: Server Connection connected or not
    - uptime: System uptime in minutes, defaults warning 10
    critical 5
    - disk\_available: Disk space available in Mb, defaults warning 500
    critical 100
    - disk\_used: Disk space used in percentage, defaults warning 90
    critical 95
    - cpu\_temp: CPU temperature in degrees Celcius, defaults warning 80
    critical 85

# DIAGNOSTICS

- Could not retrieve page '%s' to get data
(E) The resource containing the data could not be retrieved from the host
- Could not get data from resource '%s' for function '%s'
(E) The resource containing the data could be retrieved from the host but the
requested data was not found in that object
- Unknown function '%s', must be one of connected, consumer, cpu\_temp,
disk\_available, disk\_used, forwarding, producer, status, uptime, version (E)
The requested function is not supported, must be one of the system properties
'connected', 'consumer', 'cpu\_temp', 'disk\_available', 'disk\_used',
'forwarding', 'producer', 'status', 'uptime' or 'version'.

# EXAMPLES

`check_raspberry_shake -H rs.local -f cpu_temp`

# DEPENDENCIES

Perl 5.16.0, Monitoring::Plugin, HTTP::Tiny, JSON, List::MoreUtils, Readonly,
English

# EXIT STATUS

The exist status is handled by the monitoring interface.

# CONFIGURATION

The default warning and critical thresholds should be overridden by the
standard -w and -c options of the monitoring interface because they depend on
the usage of the device. The defaults thresholds are:

- uptime 10: 1:
- disk\_available 500: 100:
- disk\_used 90 95
- cpu\_temp 80: 85:

# INCOMPATIBILITIES

There are no known incompatibilities but since the data is retrieved from an
API in an undefined format, a different system software version could present
the data in a different format which might break things. It is compatible with
system software version `0.15`.

# BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The 'status' function only determines between 'RUNNING' and not.

The 'producer', 'consumer', 'forwarding' and 'connected' functions only
determines between 'ON'/'CONNECTED' and not.
